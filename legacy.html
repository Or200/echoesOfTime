      Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue (known
      informally as Dangerous Dave 3) was published by Softdisk in 1993, and is
      the first Dangerous Dave game to not be programmed by John Romero. This is
      because he, John Carmack, Adrian Carmack and Tom Hall had left Softdisk by
      this point to form id Software. It was followed by a sequel, Dave Goes
      Nutz!, which shares similar gameplay elements. Like the previous title,
      Dangerous Dave is on a mission to save his little brother Delbert, this
      time from the evil "Dr. Nemesis" (who is also the main antagonist in
      Softdisk's Catacomb franchise). Dave Goes Nutz! Dave Goes Nutz! (known
      informally as Dangerous Dave 4) was published by Softdisk in 1993 for. It
      continues from Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue, where Dangerous Dave is on a
      mission to save his little brother Delbert, from the evil "Dr. Nemesis"
      (who is also the main antagonist in Softdisk's Catacomb franchise). The
      game takes place within a psychiatric hospital filled with zombies.
